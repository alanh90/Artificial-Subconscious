# Artificial Subconscious for AGI

![Cover Image](media/cover_img.png)

## **Abstract**

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems traditionally rely on deterministic or goal-seeking models to achieve tasks, often lacking the nuanced depth of human-like intuition. The **Artificial Subconscious** is a conceptual framework designed to emulate subconscious processing, acting as an intrusive thought suggestion mechanism rather than a goal-seeking entity. This system generates hypothetical scenarios, evaluates potential outcomes, and introduces creative variability into the decision-making process. 

Operating continuously in the background, the **Artificial Subconscious** pairs with other AI components to enhance adaptability, creativity, and alignment with human-like cognition. While no implementation exists yet, the framework lays the foundation for an innovative layer in AI architecture.

## **Introduction**

Human cognition is multi-layered, with the subconscious playing a critical role in forming intrusive thoughts that can guide conscious decision-making, spark creativity, or mitigate risk. Unlike conventional AI systems that explicitly pursue goals, the **Artificial Subconscious** is envisioned as a passive, always-on process, continuously generating possible scenarios and injecting them into other systems for consideration.

This framework is designed to complement existing goal-seeking AI systems, offering valuable insights through its ability to imagine, suggest, and balance possibilities without dictating outcomes. This document outlines the conceptual structure and processes of the **Artificial Subconscious**, emphasizing its theoretical nature and potential integration with broader AI architectures.

---

## **Objective**

The **Artificial Subconscious** is not goal-driven. Instead, its primary objective is to continuously produce and evaluate hypothetical scenarios that other AI systems can interpret, adopt, or discard. This introduces creative variability and life-like qualities to AI through its persistent and independent processing.

### **Key Functions**

1. **Scenario Generation:** Generate diverse, hypothetical future scenarios based on noise, memory, and patterns.
2. **Intrusive Thought Injection:** Continuously present suggestions or "what-if" scenarios to other AI systems.
3. **Non-Goal-Driven Adaptability:** Operate independently, adapting to changing inputs without explicit directives.
4. **Enhancement of Decision Systems:** Complement goal-oriented AI systems by offering a pool of ideas and risk-aware alternatives.

---

## **Framework Overview**

The **Artificial Subconscious** operates through a multi-layered architecture, simulating subconscious thought processes. Each layer is designed to process raw inputs, generate potential scenarios, and evaluate their utility and risk before presenting them as suggestions.

---

### **Layer 1: Noise and Memory Integration**

**Purpose:** Create a baseline for subconscious activity by integrating random variability (noise) with memory to simulate subconscious thought patterns.

#### **Mechanisms:**

1. **Random Noise Generation:**
   - Simulates subconscious creativity by introducing variability.
   - Ensures exploration of unconventional ideas.

2. **Memory Integration:**
   - Leverages past experiences to shape patterns.
   - Weights successes and risks to balance creativity with caution.

#### **Formula:**

$$
N = N_{\text{random}} + N_{\text{memory}}
$$

--- 

### **Layer 2: Significant Data Extraction**

**Purpose:** Identify meaningful patterns from the integrated data to balance success-driven insights with risk awareness and creativity.

**Process:**

1. **Peak Identification (Possible Successes):**
   - Extracts data points representing significant successes (peaks) from the integrated data.
   - Peaks are associated with patterns that have historically demonstrated high utility or reward.

2. **Valley Identification (Possible Risks):**
   - Identifies data points representing notable risks (valleys) to ensure awareness of potential pitfalls.
   - Valleys help contextualize and mitigate risks during decision-making.

3. **Controlled Randomness:**
   - Introduces variability around identified peaks and valleys, ensuring exploration of creative or unconventional associations.

---

### **Layer 3: Hypothetical Scenario Generation**

**Purpose:** Generate intrusive, hypothetical scenarios by combining extracted patterns with random variations.

#### **Mechanisms:**

- **Scenario Creation:** Continuously generates potential futures, ranging from plausible to highly imaginative.
- **Scenario Evolution:** Refines scenarios using new data and controlled randomness.

#### **Formula:**

$$
S_{\text{next}} = S_{\text{current}} + \Delta S_{\text{learning}} + \eta_{\text{random}}
$$

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Estimates potential benefits and risks for each scenario.

**Scenario Evaluation Formula:**

**Scenario Score = α × Benefit − γ × Risk**

- Scenario Score: Score assigned to each scenario.
- α, γ: Weighting coefficients for benefit and risk.

---

### **Layer 4: Scenario Evaluation and Ranking**

**Purpose:** Evaluate scenarios for their potential utility and risk, offering prioritized suggestions.

#### **Mechanisms:**

1. **Consolidation:**
   - Groups similar scenarios into clusters to identify common patterns and avoid redundancy.
   - Consolidation reduces cognitive and computational overload by focusing on distinct scenarios.

2. **Utility and Risk Balancing:**
   - Each scenario is evaluated using a composite score that considers:
     - Historical success rates, representing the likelihood of positive outcomes.
     - Scenario-specific risk factors, ensuring risk-aware ranking.

**Scenario Ranking Formula:**

$$
R_{\text{rank}} = \frac{R_{\text{score}} \cdot H_{\text{success}}}{1 + R_{\text{risk}}}
$$

---

### **Layer 5: Final Scenario Selection**

**Purpose:** Select the most promising scenarios for presentation to the system for further processing, balancing reward, routine effectiveness, and diversity. Unlike purely penalizing scenarios for similarity, this process acknowledges the value of successful routines while also prioritizing unique and creative alternatives when appropriate.

---

### **Process:**

1. **Selection Criteria:**
   - **Reward Potential** $R(S_i)$ : Scenarios are evaluated based on their intrinsic benefits, such as alignment with the system's overarching goals or their potential to create novel opportunities.
   - **Routine Success Factor** $H_{\text{success}}$ : Scenarios with a history of high performance are favored to emulate the human tendency to rely on effective routines.
   - **Diversity Factor** $D_f$ : Unique scenarios are given additional weight to ensure a balanced set of creative and conventional options.

2. **Weighted Scoring:**
   - Scenarios are ranked using a composite score that considers reward, routine success, and diversity. 
   - The weighting coefficients ($\gamma$ for risk, $\alpha$ for routine success, and $\beta$ for diversity) enable dynamic adjustment based on the desired balance between routine and novelty.

3. **Thresholding and Filtering:**
   - A predefined threshold can be applied to ensure all selected scenarios meet a minimum standard for reward and effectiveness.
   - Scenarios deemed overly redundant but not historically successful may still be deprioritized in favor of diverse options.

---

### **Enhanced Final Selection Score Formula:**

$$
S_{\text{final}} = \frac{R(S_i) + \alpha H_{\text{success}} - \gamma R_k(S_i)}{1 + \beta D_f}
$$

**Where:**

$$
\begin{aligned}
& S_{\text{final}} : \text{Final composite score of a scenario.} \\
& R(S_i) : \text{Reward or benefit score associated with scenario } S_i. \\
& H_{\text{success}} : \text{Historical success metric of scenario } S_i. \\
& R_k(S_i) : \text{Risk score of scenario } S_i, \text{ weighted by a coefficient } \gamma. \\
& \alpha : \text{Routine success weighting factor, emphasizing high-performing patterns.} \\
& \beta : \text{Diversity weighting factor, favoring uniqueness while balancing routine.} \\
& D_f : \text{Diversity factor, promoting variety by penalizing redundancy in less effective scenarios.}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

### **Key Enhancements**

- **Reward-Driven Routines:** 
  - Scenarios with a strong history of success ($H_{\text{success}}$) are favored, ensuring the system values repeated effectiveness similar to human reliance on routine.

- **Balancing Routine and Creativity:** 
  - The formula allows for both successful routines and innovative alternatives by balancing the weights of $H_{\text{success}}$ and $D_f$. Highly unique scenarios are given a chance to be shared, even if they deviate from the norm.

- **Context-Specific Adaptability:** 
  - The coefficients $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ can be dynamically adjusted to suit the system's objectives. For instance, an exploratory system may favor diversity ($\beta$), while a safety-critical application may favor routine success ($\alpha$).

---

### **Integration into the Artificial Subconscious Framework**

- **Input:** Layer 5 receives scored scenarios from Layer 4, which have already been evaluated for reward, risk, and historical success.
- **Processing:** It recalculates scores by integrating routine success ($H_{\text{success}}$) and diversity ($D_f$) into the scoring process.
- **Output:** It generates a final ranked list of scenarios, including high-reward routines and uniquely creative options for downstream systems.

---

### **Illustrative Example**

Suppose the system generates the following scenarios:

- **Scenario A:** High reward, moderate risk, and a history of strong performance.
- **Scenario B:** Moderate reward, low risk, and highly unique.
- **Scenario C:** High reward, high risk, and moderately unique.

Using the formula:

- **Scenario A** would score highly due to its high $R(S_i)$ and $H_{\text{success}}$, making it a strong candidate for selection as a proven routine.
- **Scenario B** would achieve a balanced score because of its uniqueness ($D_f$) and low risk ($R_k(S_i)$), ensuring it has a chance to be presented despite a moderate reward.
- **Scenario C** would be more dependent on the risk tolerance coefficient ($\gamma$); if $\gamma$ is low (risk-tolerant system), it might still be selected due to its high reward.

The final output reflects a mix of high-reward routines and creative alternatives, emulating human decision-making processes that balance habitual success with the exploration of new ideas.

---

### **Summary**

Layer 5 acts as a decision filter that refines the set of hypothetical scenarios into an actionable output. By integrating routine success into the scoring process alongside reward and diversity, it emulates human-like reasoning patterns. This ensures the Artificial Subconscious maintains a balance between valuing proven routines and promoting creative alternatives, enhancing adaptability, creativity, and alignment with human-like thought processes.
