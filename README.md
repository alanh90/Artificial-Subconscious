<div align="center">  <img src="media/coverimg.png" alt="Cover Image"></div>

## Abstract

The Hungry Emergent Cognition Framework (HECF) presents a novel architecture for creative AI, overcoming the constraints of deterministic systems. It uses a multi-layered structure that fosters emergent behavior by integrating controlled stochastic processes, context-aware memories, and hierarchical evaluations, to produce diverse and refined outputs applicable across various domains. HECF’s domain-agnostic design allows it to be versatile and adaptable across a range of technologies, providing a method for simulating artificial intuition. While an optional "Hungry Matrix" further enhances the system with an adaptive approach to data encoding that uses low-resolution areas acting as abstract concepts to improve learning, HECF also uses a separate conceptual framework for its scenario generation, which helps create more abstract and complex relationships. Validated through Large Language Model (LLM) scenario generation, HECF represents a significant advancement towards adaptable and innovative Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

## 1. Introduction

Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) strives for genuine creativity and adaptability, a challenge that current systems often struggle with due to their reliance on rigid, pre-defined algorithms. The Hungry Emergent Cognition Framework (HECF) addresses this gap with a multi-layered architecture designed to foster creative synthesis through emergent behaviors. HECF strategically combines controlled randomness with structured information, activating and weighting internal data representations based on contextual relevance. This dynamic interaction is then enhanced by hierarchical evaluation, to produce more varied and insightful AI outputs. This core functionality is domain-agnostic making it versatile in different areas, while also providing a method to simulate human intuition that could improve AGI.

HECF is not limited to a specific application, its methods for pattern creation, scenario development, and evaluation can be used in various different technologies, from language models to visual and audio synthesis, and even in abstract reasoning. We begin with testing scenario generation within Large Language Models (LLMs) to showcase how the framework can enhance creative thought. The framework also includes a method for abstracting concepts, which is further enhanced by an optional, dynamically adapting "Hungry Matrix." This matrix expands as it "hungers" for more information, creating increasingly abstract and complex representations of the data, akin to how humans learn through both abstraction and definition, opening new paths for a more creative and human-like AI. This "Hungry Matrix" acts as an optional enhancement that is independent of the other core parts of the framework.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1. Core Principles of Operation

The Hungry Emergent Cognition Framework (HECF) is founded upon three core principles, meticulously designed to enable broad applicability and pave the way toward advanced Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). These principles, when working in harmony, enable the simulation of intuitive processing and creativity within artificial systems:

#### 1. Stochastic-Deterministic Balance:HECF strategically balances randomness and structure, creating a dynamic for creative innovation.
*   **Controlled Randomness**: HECF introduces carefully calibrated multi-scale noise patterns that allow the system to explore new creative paths, that were not readily available to the model. This controlled chaos ensures the system can escape local optima and discover novel solutions, inspired by studies showing that neural noise plays a role in complex creative thought.
*   **Structured Constraints**: The randomness is balanced by defined boundaries to ensure meaningful and relevant outputs. This ensures that the system is not producing random outputs, but rather, valid data that has meaning. By combining structure with exploration, the model is both creative and practical, which is key for building an adaptive system.
*   **Emergent Interaction**: The interplay of stochastic and deterministic processes allows for a constantly evolving process of creative exploration, and the emergence of novel solutions. Chaos and structure are needed for the development of new forms and ideas, and the deterministic side, grounded in memory and context, provides stability, and the stochastic side, fueled by noise, promotes change.

#### 2. Dynamic Memory Integration:HECF's dynamic memory management prioritizes relevant, recent information for efficiency and enhanced creative exploration.
*   **Temporal Decay Management**: Mechanisms give higher priority to recent and relevant information, phasing out older data. This prevents data overload, and ensures that the model learns important data and is not limited by outdated information, similar to human memory.
*   **Contextual Relevance**: By retrieving memories based on context, the system ensures that scenario generation aligns with objectives while also being creative. The interaction between past and current context is a fundamental part of this model.
*   **Pattern Emergence**: This system synthesizes new patterns through iterative memory interaction. By exploring current contexts through the lens of past knowledge, the system can find novel relationships and new creative patterns for growth and learning.

#### 3. Hierarchical Evaluation Structures:HECF's evaluation is multi-faceted for optimal results.
*   **Multi-Criteria Assessment**: Scenarios are assessed across various dimensions including plausibility, relevance, novelty, and utility to make better informed decisions regarding what is the best possible output. This also mirrors human-like judgement in evaluating scenarios.
*   **Domain-Adaptive Metrics**: Evaluation criteria are adapted to specific applications for better output, which makes this framework versatile, relevant, and practical.
*   **Emergent Selection Processes**: The system dynamically prioritizes scenarios, promoting both innovation and contextually relevant output. This prioritizes high utility and adds a creative exploration by keeping a degree of randomness in its selections.

These principles work synergistically to empower HECF to mimic aspects of intuitive reasoning, allowing AI to autonomously generate, evaluate, and refine creative solutions, much like humans. This approach is a significant step toward AGI, enabling adaptability, creative problem-solving, and the tackling of novel problems. The result is an adaptable, creative, and intuitive AI system inspired by human cognition.

### 2.2. Core Components of HECF

The Hungry Emergent Cognition Framework is structured into five distinct layers, each performing a specific function that contributes to the overall goal of creative synthesis:

#### **Layer 1: Noisy Memory Activation and Contextual Integration**

This foundational layer manages data integration and introduces a novel approach to data encoding. It uses embeddings coupled with a dynamic noise injection process, inspired by neural noise theories. This layer may optionally include a dynamic "Hungry Matrix" which expands and evolves its data representation, and also includes a method for creating abstract concepts, both of which are independent of each other.

*   **Data Space Representation:**
    *   **Standard Option:** Represents the AI's knowledge base, such as training data, stored as token embeddings for a rich representation of semantic relationships, and facilitates context integration, as a standard method of processing data.
    *   **Optional Enhancement ("Hungry Matrix"):** As an optional enhancement, instead of standard embeddings, this layer can utilize a dynamically adaptive multi-dimensional matrix to encode and abstract features. This starts as a low-resolution matrix which represents abstract concepts, and expands based on a "hunger" metric, defining more specific features, while learning through both abstraction and definition, simulating human learning. The low-resolution matrix naturally represents generalized abstract concepts, while the higher-resolution represents more concrete concepts. This **expansion of the "hungry matrix" is controlled by a "hunger" mechanism,** which is derived from several factors that include:
        *   **Training Loss**: If the training loss reaches a stable point, it implies that the system has extracted the maximum amount of information from the current matrix resolution.
        *   **Fluctuation of Data**: During training if the matrix sub-structures have reached stability, that implies that no more information is being encoded.
        *   **Entropy**: If entropy drops below a certain threshold, this means that the matrix isn’t "hungry" for new information.
        *   **Time based**: A simple timer can also trigger an expansion based on the training duration since the last expansion.
        *   This expansion involves creating new dimensions and sub-structures from stable areas, by using:
            *   **Sub-Matrix Creation**: Areas with stable training can become their own higher-resolution matrices.
            *   **Dimensional Increase:** New dimensions can be added to existing matrices to represent more concepts.
            *   **Hybrid**: The model may use a hybrid approach and choose different expansion methods.
        *   This expansion process repeats, leading to layers of matrix resolutions, where each level represents an increasingly refined understanding of the data.
*   **Concept Abstraction:** The system includes a method for creating high-level abstract concepts from its input. This is not limited to the “Hungry Matrix” and is a separate feature, which allows this framework to generate output that operates with concepts. This process involves identifying recurring patterns and relationships in data and representing them as abstract ideas, which can be more efficient than constantly dealing with concrete data and also can provide more creative outputs by using more generalized ideas.
*   **Memory Activation:** When new context is presented to the AI, related memories are activated. These memories are identified based on the similarity of their embeddings, or from “Hungry Matrix” sub-structures to the current context. Metrics like cosine similarity are used to determine these relationships, ensuring that the activation is contextually relevant. The memories that are activated can be a mix of previously encoded token embeddings, and abstract representations from previous matrix sub-structures, and extracted concepts, allowing for a very varied, and creative mix for generating responses.
*   **Importance Weighting:** The system assigns higher importance weights to activated memories and relevant abstract concepts, proportional to their contextual relevance. This ensures that the most important pieces of information are highlighted and given higher priority in the subsequent processes. This also highlights relevant knowledge, and experiences which can act as a basis for future creative endeavors.
*   **Noise Injection:** This layer also introduces controlled stochastic noise into the weighted data space at multiple scales. “Soft noise” introduces broad associations, while “fine-grained noise” explores specific connections and allows the model to go off script. This noise is not just random, but is influenced by past noise patterns, creating temporal dependencies and directionality in the exploration. It provides the variability and adaptability for the model to be more creative, and not be bound by its past or its training data, or get trapped in local minima.
*   **Residual Integration:** The system integrates a small amount of the previous layer’s output, which helps establish temporal links between successive operations, further enhancing the dynamic nature of the model. This also gives the model a sense of direction by following past trends and outputs, allowing for consistency, but also by introducing chaos and noise it's able to deviate.
*   **Example:** When given an input like "a person walks to a horse farm," the tokens "person," "walk," "horse," and "farm" would have their embeddings weighted higher. With the "Hungry Matrix" option, the initial low-resolution matrix may only abstract the core concepts such as "Person", and "Place", and will then begin to define those concepts more concretely as the matrix expands. This layer uses noise injection to help discover more related terms and also unrelated terms that the model could use for creative endeavors.

Layer 1 provides the framework for creative exploration. The integration of noise with contextual memory and temporal dependencies ensures a diverse set of possibilities, while remaining grounded in prior knowledge, and the optional inclusion of the "Hungry Matrix", and the method for creating abstract concepts gives the model more advanced capabilities.

---

#### **Layer 2: Significant Data Element Extraction**

This layer acts as a filter on the noisy data space, identifying the most salient data elements and abstract concepts for subsequent processing. This layer is a bridge between the raw possibilities from Layer 1 and the more creative, and defined outputs of Layer 3.

*   **Peak and Valley Identification:** This process identifies "peaks," which are the data elements with high importance weights, and "valleys," the data elements with low importance weights. This is based on a simple threshold system, where any data point over the peak threshold becomes a peak, and under the valley threshold is a valley. The peaks are given priority, while a few of the valleys are also selected to ensure some randomness in the output. The peak detection is meant to highlight the core elements, while the valleys provide a source of creativity and exploration.
*   **Controlled Randomness (Minimal):** A small subset of “valleys” (low-importance elements) are also selected to introduce minimal unexpected variations, and novelty into the creative process. This process ensures that the system does not just focus on what is already deemed important and explore other possibilities for more creative scenarios, as sometimes seemingly unrelated pieces of information can generate new ideas.
*   **Abstract Concept Extraction:** With the optional "Hungry Matrix," low-resolution sub-structures are extracted as abstract concepts. These sub-structures represent a generalized, and often more abstract understanding of what the input data is. In addition, using the models concepting framework it is also able to extract concepts from the token embeddings data as well.
*   **Output:** A refined set of data points—primarily peaks, with a few valleys, and extracted abstract concepts—is passed on to the next layer for scenario generation. This refined set ensures that the most relevant data is being used in the next step, and its not limited to just that, it also includes abstract concepts, and unrelated information, giving it a strong foundation for creative output.

Layer 2 acts as a strategic filter to highlight useful data, and also introduce noise and unrelated ideas for additional creative exploration. It maintains a balance between focusing on practical data, and also ensuring that the framework does not get stuck and instead explores new, creative avenues. When using the optional "Hungry Matrix," this includes the ability to select key sub-structures and their abstract representations, providing even more diverse data.

#### **Key Functions**

1.  **Pattern Recognition:**
    *   Peak Identification (Opportunities): Highlights elements with high utility or potential.
    *   Valley Identification (Unrelated Ideas): Adds unrelated elements to explore creative diversions.
    *   Abstract Concept Extraction: Uses the Hungry Matrix or models concepting framework to extract abstract concepts from the data.
2.  **Controlled Randomness:**
    *   Variability Introduction: Adds slight randomness for exploration around identified peaks.
    *   Avoiding Stagnation: Ensures the system does not get stuck in local optima and maintains a degree of adaptability.

**Output:** A refined set of data points, representing significant opportunities, selected unrelated ideas, and extracted abstract concepts for the next layer.

---

#### **Layer 3: Hypothetical Scenario Generation**

This layer leverages the extracted data elements, including abstract concepts, to construct potential scenarios. It emphasizes concept-driven generation and hierarchical planning, which enhances the model's output through more detailed and varied creative results.

*   **Scenario Construction:**
    *   **Concept Selection:** This layer receives data from Layer 2, which includes a mix of token embeddings, sub-structures from the "Hungry Matrix", and abstract concepts that were extracted using either the "Hungry Matrix" or its own conceptual framework.
    *   **Concept Anchors:** These identified concepts act as anchors for scenario generation. The concepts help guide the creative process by providing important information that it needs to take into consideration.
    *   **Concept-Driven Generation:** The system uses a scenario generator (such as an LLM) that constructs scenarios using these core concepts. The goal is not for it to always include all of them, since that can create repetitive results, instead it allows for creative freedom and ensures that not every scenario is similar to the other, but still keeps within the guidelines of the abstract concepts and concrete data provided.
    *   **Concept Expansion**: The scenario generator can also expand on the selected concepts. For instance, if a concept is "innovation" then the model may expand on it using different ways. Or if the main concept was "food," the expansion may be "italian food," which helps make the output more varied and detailed.
    *   **Novel Concept Creation:** The system has the ability to introduce new concepts into the scenarios, this may come from combining previously extracted concepts or extrapolating new concepts. This process increases the variability of the output, by making scenarios that are more original, and creative.
    *   **Multi-Concept Linkage:** The layer focuses on creating scenarios that emphasize the relationships between different concepts rather than just generating a set of random scenarios that may not always fit with each other.
    *   **Hierarchical Scenario Planning:**
        *   **Abstract Planning:** The model uses concept embeddings to generate scenarios at varying levels of abstraction, this means the model is able to plan a high-level general idea and then detail it further through concrete scenarios.
        *   **Dynamic Planning:** The system is able to modify and evolve scenarios to explore new paths that may come to mind during the generation process, giving it adaptability.
    *   **Residual History:** The residual memory system is used to store recently used concepts, and newly generated scenarios which influence the next operations by ensuring the system is both creative, but also has consistency in its output. This encourages the exploration of related themes or helps prevent the generation of repetitive outputs.
    *   **Example:** Continuing with the "horse farm" example, the identified concepts are “person,” “horse,” “farm,” and abstract concepts like "connection" and "nature." The layer could produce scenarios such as:
        *   "A person rides a horse on a farm, enjoying a connection with nature.”
        *   "The person visits the farm to create a connection with the horses."
        *   "The person is thinking about what kind of farm she should buy."
        *   "The person dreams of riding a horse on the beach,"
        all which are very diverse but still maintain a connection to the core ideas of the context.

Layer 3 serves as a core creative engine of HECF by converting the selected data elements and abstract concepts into a diverse set of scenarios. It emphasizes a concept-driven approach, ensuring the AI is both proactive, and innovative. This layer also does hierarchical planning, making the model be able to both explore high level concepts, and then ground those concepts by using concrete details and sub-scenarios.

#### **Key Functions**

*   **Scenario Creation:**
    *   Continuous Generation: Continuously generates a steady stream of potential scenarios.
    *   Range of Possibilities: Ensures a broad range of possibilities, that balance plausibility with creativity.
*   **Scenario Evolution:**
    *   Adaptive Refinement: Updates scenarios based on new data and feedback.
    *   Learning Mechanisms: Enhances scenarios by using learning techniques.
*   **Concept Integration:**
    *   Abstract Concept Utilization: Leverages high-level, abstract concepts.
    *   Multi-Concept Linkage: Creates scenarios that focus on the connections and relationships between different concepts.

**Output:** A diverse set of hypothetical scenarios grounded by both concrete and abstract concepts. These are ready for evaluation in the next stage.

#### **Layer 4: Scenario Evaluation and Ranking**

This layer evaluates generated scenarios based on multiple criteria to determine their overall value and relevance. It emphasizes a multi-dimensional approach to analysis, ensuring the system selects for the most beneficial scenarios and also those that explore new concepts, to maintain creativity.

*   **Multi-Criteria Assessment:** Scenarios are evaluated across various dimensions. These dimensions are key to determining the effectiveness of the model:
    *   **Plausibility:** The likelihood of the scenario occurring in the real world, giving it an aspect of reality testing.
    *   **Relevance:** How well the scenario aligns with the current context and input that was provided, which is essential to make the output relevant.
    *   **Novelty:** The degree to which the scenario differs from previously generated ones, which allows the system to maintain creativity and innovation.
    *   **Utility:** The usefulness of the scenario for the AI’s current task, focusing on the practical applications of the output.
    *   **Concept Adherence:** How well the scenario incorporates the identified concepts, including the abstract ones, and if it explores the relationships between them. This includes both the selection of concepts, and also if the selected concepts are used in a way that demonstrates creativity and understanding of those concepts.
*   **Ranking:** Scenarios are ranked based on a weighted combination of these criteria. This allows for a dynamic prioritization of scenarios based on what is needed by the model at that point in time.
*   **Output:** A ranked list of scenarios, along with associated scores, which will be used in the next selection step.

Layer 4 ensures that the model generates scenarios that are not just diverse and unique, but are also useful, and grounded by its objectives. This evaluation system is essential for optimizing the system’s performance and aligning its creative capabilities with specific goals. The use of multi criteria provides a better evaluation of those scenarios, and allows the model to use a more nuanced approach, similar to human judgement.

#### **Key Functions**

1.  **Consolidation:**
    *   Clustering Techniques: Groups scenarios based on common themes.
    *   Redundancy Reduction: Streamlines processing by removing duplicates.
2.  **Utility and Creativity Balancing:**
    *   Composite Scoring: Evaluates scenarios with a multi-criteria system.
    *   Relevance Assessment: Aligns scenarios with current objectives and requirements.
    *   **Concept Adherence:**
        *   Exploration of Concept Relationships: Scores how well the model explores the connections between its selected concepts.
        *   Abstract Concept Grounding: Evaluates how well the model grounds its output through abstract concepts.

**Output:** A ranked list of scenarios with associated scores that is now optimized for actionability, with concept adherence as an added metric.

---

#### **Layer 5: Surface-Level Scenario Selection**

This final layer selects the most promising scenarios and prepares them for integration with external systems, like a LLM model. It is the bridge between the internal process and the external world.

*   **Selection:** This is the final selection, and it chooses the top *N* ranked scenarios from the previous layer (e.g., 3-5), while also ensuring that it includes a few of the lowest-ranked scenarios (to maintain some exploration). This provides a balance between high-utility scenarios, and more explorative and abstract scenarios. The system also prioritizes scenarios that explore abstract concepts, to further enhance the creative abilities of the framework.
*   **Integration:** The selected scenarios are presented to downstream systems in a format that is compatible with them. This is done by using methods that are specific to that use case. For example, when integrating with LLMs, the system could append the scenarios to the prompt, or use them to bias the generation process. Lower-ranked scenarios can be used as negative examples. This helps guide the external systems toward better outcomes by highlighting negative examples and also helps maintain creativity by pushing for less predictable results.
*   **Example:** In a Chain-of-Thought prompting scenario, the selected scenarios will be added to the prompt before generating the final answer. The system would include top-ranked scenarios as solutions and lower-ranked as negative examples, while also adding abstract concepts to further encourage creative outputs from the external model. This ensures that the external system is influenced by the best possible outcomes based on the evaluations, while also not being too predictable and explorative.

Layer 5 acts as the interface between the HECF and external systems, presenting the best scenarios, which are now optimized for actionability by being a mix of high utility, low utility, and abstract ideas.

#### **Key Functions**

1.  **Selection Criteria:**
    *   Reward Potential: Evaluates each scenario based on the expected benefits and its usefulness.
    *   Diversity Factor: Ensures that the final output contains novel scenarios.
    *   Abstract Concept Representation: Prioritizes scenarios with abstract concepts, giving it both practical and explorative creativity.
2.  **Weighted Scoring:**
    *   Dynamic Adjustment: Tunes the weighting in real-time and as needed.
    *   Composite Evaluation: The evaluation includes multiple factors to generate the final scores.
3.  **Thresholding and Filtering:**
    *   Minimum Standards: The system filters out low-quality scenarios.
    *   Redundancy Penalization: It penalizes overly similar scenarios, which helps make the final output more diverse and creative.

**Output:** A curated set of scenarios, optimized for actionability, and ready to be integrated into external systems.
