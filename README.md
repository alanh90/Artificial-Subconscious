# Artificial-Subconscious

![Cover Image](media/cover_img.png)

## Overview
**Artificial-Subconscious** is an innovative system designed to simulate a subconscious-like process within an AI. Its operation can be summarized as:

$$
\text{AI}_{\text{subconscious}} = f(\text{Noise}, \text{Memory}, \text{Scenarios}) \rightarrow \text{Decision}
$$

Inspired by human cognition, this model processes raw inputs (noise), extracts meaningful insights, generates hypothetical scenarios, and evaluates them for relevance and risk. The ultimate goal is to enhance decision-making and adaptability in artificial intelligence systems, bridging the gap between human-like intuition and computational precision.

Primary objective:

$$
\text{Goal} = \text{Maximize Adaptability} + \text{Enhance Decision Precision}
$$

## Key Features

### **1. Layered Sub-Conscious Processing Architecture**
A multi-layered approach to simulate subconscious thought processes:

#### **Layer 1: Noise Generation**
- Generates foundational noise for subconscious simulation
- Combines:
  - Random noise
  - Relevant memory data related to the current situation

- Noise includes **valleys** and **peaks** to prioritize:
  - **Peaks:** Previous data with successful outcomes or benefits
  - **Valleys:** Data associated with negative consequences or risks

Key formulas:
$$
N(x, y, z) = R(x, y, z) + M(x, y, z)
$$
where:
- $R(x, y, z) \sim U(a, b)$: Uniformly distributed random noise
- $M(x, y, z)$: Memory-retrieved data prioritized by:
$$
M(x, y, z) = w_i \cdot \text{Success}_{\text{past}} - v_i \cdot \text{Risk}_{\text{past}}
$$

Peaks and valleys in the noise field are defined as:
$$
S_{\text{peak}} = \text{max}(N(x, y, z)), \quad S_{\text{valley}} = \text{min}(N(x, y, z))
$$

#### **Layer 2: Identification of Useful Data**
Semi-random data points are extracted:
$$
D = \{ S_{\text{peak}}, S_{\text{valley}}, \epsilon \}
$$
where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ introduces randomness. Each point is weighted by:
$$
w_i = \frac{e^{\beta S_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{\beta S_j}}
$$
where:
- $\beta$: Sensitivity scaling parameter
- $S_i$: Relevance score

#### **Layer 3: Hypothetical Scenario Creation**
Scenarios are generated as:
$$
S_i = \{ x_j + \epsilon_j : x_j \in D, \epsilon_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2) \}
$$
and evaluated by the benefit-risk function:
$$
B_r(S_i) = \alpha \cdot B(S_i) - \gamma \cdot R(S_i)
$$
where:
- $B(S_i)$: Expected benefit
- $R(S_i)$: Associated risk
- $\alpha, \gamma$: Importance weights

#### **Layer 4: Probability-Based Sorting**
The sorting function ranks scenarios as:
$$
P(S_i) = \frac{e^{\lambda B_r(S_i)}}{\sum_{j} e^{\lambda B_r(S_j)}}
$$
where $\lambda$ controls the impact of $B_r(S_i)$.

#### **Layer 5: Final Scenario Selection**
The top $N$ scenarios are selected as:
$$
S_{\text{final}} = \text{TopN}(S, P(S))
$$

### **2. Dynamic Scenario Generation**
Scenarios evolve based on the Markov process:
$$
x_{t+1} = f(x_t) + \eta_t
$$
where:
- $f(x_t)$: Transition function for system state
- $\eta_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$: Randomness at time $t$

Expected outcomes are calculated using Monte Carlo methods:
$$
E(O) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(S_i, X)
$$

### **3. Risk and Benefit Analysis**
Probabilities are refined through Bayesian updates:
$$
P(O | S_i) = \frac{P(S_i | O) \cdot P(O)}{P(S_i)}
$$
and the final risk-benefit ratio is given by:
$$
R_b(S_i) = \frac{B(S_i)}{1 + R(S_i)}
$$

## Use Cases

### **1. Autonomous Systems**
Adaptability in real-time decision-making is modeled as:
$$
dx_t = f(x_t, t) dt + g(x_t, t) dW_t
$$
where:
- $dx_t$: Change in state
- $g(x_t, t)$: Diffusion term introducing environmental randomness
- $dW_t$: Wiener process

### **2. Strategic AI**
Simulated outcomes follow:
$$
O = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(S_i, X)
$$

### **3. Creative AI**
Scenarios are generated using variational autoencoders:
$$
p(S | z) = p(S) \cdot q(z | S)
$$
where:
- $z$: Latent space representation

### **4. Risk Management**
Dynamic risk balancing adjusts weights as:
$$
\text{Risk}_{\text{new}} = \text{Risk}_{\text{current}} \cdot (1 + \eta)
$$
where $\eta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$

## Why Artificial-Subconscious?
The project enhances AI adaptability, creativity, and intuition by incorporating a layered mathematical framework:
$$
\text{AI}_{\text{adaptive}} = f(\text{SubConsciousLayer})
$$

This project aims to provide AI systems with a "subconscious" layer that operates beneath conscious decision-making, offering:
- **Improved Adaptability**: Processes complex and unstructured inputs to uncover meaningful insights
- **Enhanced Creativity**: Simulates diverse scenarios, including high-risk possibilities
- **Human-Like Intuition**: Mimics subconscious processing for better alignment with human-like reasoning

## Implementation Details
The system is implemented using a combination of:
- Neural networks for pattern recognition
- Monte Carlo methods for scenario simulation
- Bayesian inference for probability updates
- Markov processes for state transitions
