# Artificial Subconscious for AGI

![Cover Image](media/cover_img.png)

## Abstract

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have traditionally relied on deterministic and probabilistic models for decision-making, lacking the nuanced and intuitive capabilities observed in human cognition. The **Artificial Subconscious** framework introduces a novel conceptual approach inspired by the human subconscious to enhance adaptability, creativity, and intuitive reasoning in AI systems. By processing raw inputs through layers of memory integration, pattern recognition, scenario generation, and evaluation, this framework aims to simulate subconscious cognitive processes. While currently theoretical, this approach offers a foundation for developing AI systems capable of operating effectively in dynamic and uncertain environments.

## Introduction

Human cognition operates on multiple levels, with the subconscious playing a critical role in intuitive decision-making, creativity, and adaptive reasoning. Inspired by this, the **Artificial Subconscious** framework proposes a layered architecture designed to mimic these processes. While conventional AI focuses on explicit, conscious reasoning, this framework introduces subconscious-like mechanisms to explore, hypothesize, and balance decision-making processes with creativity and risk awareness.

This repo outlines the conceptual design of the framework, providing detailed descriptions of its components and processes. Future work will involve formal coding, experimentation, and validation to quantify the efficacy of the approach.

### **Primary Objective:**

Maximize the following goal function:

$$
\text{Goal} = \text{Maximize}( \alpha \cdot \text{Adaptability} + \beta \cdot \text{Decision Precision} + \gamma \cdot \text{Intuitive Understanding} )
$$

**Where:**

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \alpha, \beta, \gamma : \text{Coefficients representing the importance of each component.} \\
& \text{Adaptability} : \text{The AI's ability to adjust to new or changing conditions.} \\
& \text{Decision Precision} : \text{The accuracy of the decisions made by the AI.} \\
& \text{Intuitive Understanding} : \text{The AI's capacity to emulate human-like intuition and insight.}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Layered Subconscious Processing Architecture

The framework consists of multiple layers that emulate subconscious thought processes:

### **Layer 1: Noise and Memory Integration**

**Purpose:** Generate a foundational data set that simulates subconscious thoughts by combining random variability and context-aware memory integration.

**Process:**

1. **Random Noise Generation:**
   - Introduces variability into the system, fostering creativity and exploration.

2. **Memory Integration:**
   - Incorporates weighted past experiences related to the current context.
   - Emphasizes successes while cautioning against past risks to balance creativity and caution.

**Formula for Noise and Memory Integration:**

$$
N = N_{\text{random}} + N_{\text{memory}}
$$

**Where:**

$$
N_{\text{memory}} = w_{\text{success}} \cdot S_{\text{past}} - w_{\text{risk}} \cdot R_{\text{past}}
$$

**Definitions:**

$$
\begin{aligned}
& N : \text{Combined noise and memory-based data set.} \\
& N_{\text{random}} : \text{Randomly generated noise to introduce variability.} \\
& N_{\text{memory}} : \text{Weighted data from past experiences.} \\
& w_{\text{success}} : \text{Weight emphasizing the impact of past successes.} \\
& w_{\text{risk}} : \text{Weight emphasizing the caution against past risks.} \\
& S_{\text{past}} : \text{Historical success data.} \\
& R_{\text{past}} : \text{Historical risk data.}
\end{aligned}
$$


--- 

### **Layer 2: Significant Data Extraction**

**Purpose:** Identify meaningful patterns from the integrated data to balance success-driven insights with risk awareness and creativity.

**Process:**

1. **Peak Identification:**
   - Extracts data points representing significant successes (peaks) from the integrated data.
   - Peaks are associated with patterns that have historically demonstrated high utility or reward.

2. **Valley Identification:**
   - Identifies data points representing notable risks (valleys) to ensure awareness of potential pitfalls.
   - Valleys help contextualize and mitigate risks during decision-making.

3. **Controlled Randomness:**
   - Introduces variability around identified peaks and valleys, ensuring exploration of creative or unconventional associations.

**Pattern Importance Calculation:**

$$
V_{\text{pattern}} = \frac{B_{\text{historical}}}{1 + R_{\text{historical}}}
$$

**Where:**

$$
\begin{aligned}
& V_{\text{pattern}} : \text{Value of the identified pattern.} \\
& B_{\text{historical}} : \text{Historical benefit associated with the pattern.} \\
& R_{\text{historical}} : \text{Historical risk associated with the pattern.}
\end{aligned}
$$


---

### **Layer 3: Hypothetical Scenario Generation**

**Purpose:** Create potential future scenarios based on significant data patterns.

**Process:**

- **Scenario Creation:** Generates a diverse set of scenarios, including high-benefit, high-risk, and random variations.
  - **Purpose:** Continuously generate and evolve scenarios based on current inputs and learning.

  **Process:**
  
  - **Scenario Evolution:** Updates scenarios by incorporating learning and controlled randomness.
  
  **Evolution Formula:**
  
  $$
  S_{\text{next}} = S_{\text{current}} + \Delta S_{\text{learning}} + \eta_{\text{random}}
  $$
  
  $$
  \text{where:}
  \begin{aligned}
  & S_{\text{next}} : \text{The next state of the system.} \\
  & S_{\text{current}} : \text{The current state of the system.} \\
  & \Delta S_{\text{learning}} : \text{The change in state driven by learning or adaptation.} \\
  & \eta_{\text{random}} : \text{Controlled randomness introduced to simulate variability or creativity.}
  \end{aligned}
  $$

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Estimates potential benefits and risks for each scenario.

**Scenario Evaluation Formula:**

**Scenario Score = α × Benefit − γ × Risk**

- Scenario Score: Score assigned to each scenario.
- α, γ: Weighting coefficients for benefit and risk.

### **Layer 4: Scenario Evaluation and Ranking**

**Purpose:** Evaluate and rank scenarios based on their viability, balancing historical success, scenario score, and associated risks.

**Process:**

1. **Consolidation:**
   - Groups similar scenarios into clusters to identify common patterns and avoid redundancy.
   - Consolidation reduces cognitive and computational overload by focusing on distinct scenarios.

2. **Scoring:**
   - Each scenario is evaluated using a composite score that considers:
     - Historical success rates, representing the likelihood of positive outcomes.
     - Scenario-specific risk factors, ensuring risk-aware ranking.

**Scenario Ranking Formula:**

$$
R_{\text{rank}} = \frac{R_{\text{score}} \cdot H_{\text{success}}}{1 + R_{\text{risk}}}
$$

**Where:**

$$
\begin{aligned}
& R_{\text{rank}} : \text{Final ranking score for the scenario.} \\
& R_{\text{score}} : \text{Intrinsic scenario score derived from its benefit or reward potential.} \\
& H_{\text{success}} : \text{Historical success metric, indicating the frequency or magnitude of past positive outcomes.} \\
& R_{\text{risk}} : \text{Adjusted risk factor, penalizing scenarios with higher associated risks.}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

#### **Layer 5: Final Scenario Selection**

**Purpose:** Select the most promising scenarios to present to the system for further processing, balancing reward, risk, and diversity.

**Process:**

1. **Selection Criteria:**
   - Scenarios are scored based on their potential reward \( R(S_i) \), risk \( R_k(S_i) \), and diversity factor \( D_f \).
   - A weighted score is computed to prioritize scenarios that optimize all factors.

2. **Diversity Factor:**
   - Promotes variety by penalizing similar or redundant scenarios to ensure a broad range of options.

**Final Selection Score Formula:**

$$
S_{\text{final}} = \frac{R(S_i) - \gamma R_k(S_i)}{1 + D_f}
$$

**Where:**

$$
\begin{aligned}
& S_{\text{final}} : \text{Final selection score of a scenario.} \\
& R(S_i) : \text{Reward or benefit score of scenario } S_i. \\
& R_k(S_i) : \text{Risk score of scenario } S_i, \text{ weighted by a factor } \gamma \text{ (risk tolerance coefficient).} \\
& D_f : \text{Diversity factor, which penalizes similarity among selected scenarios to ensure variety.}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Use Cases

### **1. Adaptive Decision-Making with Subconscious Interventions**

**Application:** Mimicking a human-like subconscious by introducing "intrusive thoughts" to enhance adaptability and decision-making.

**Example:** An AI personal assistant evaluates a user's planned route to work and suggests alternate paths, not just based on real-time traffic, but by simulating hypothetical scenarios such as potential accidents or delays, akin to an intrusive thought process nudging for better options.



### **2. Intrusive Thought-Driven Strategic Planning**

**Application:** Generating subconscious-like intrusive thoughts to simulate multiple outcomes and inform long-term decisions.

**Example:** An AI project manager creates scenarios like "What if a major supplier fails?" or "What if this team member leaves the project unexpectedly?" to preemptively plan contingency strategies, mirroring a human's natural anticipatory thoughts.



### **3. Subconscious Creativity and Ideation**

**Application:** Generating imaginative or unconventional ideas by introducing random yet insightful hypothetical scenarios.

**Example:** A creative AI for authors generates plot twists or character dilemmas by "intruding" with unprompted, radical ideas—like "What if the protagonist betrays their closest ally?"—to inspire novel story directions, emulating subconscious creative sparks.



### **4. Risk Awareness through Hypothetical Intrusions**

**Application:** Balancing opportunities and dangers by simulating and evaluating subconscious-like risk scenarios.

**Example:** An AI co-pilot evaluates risky landing conditions by intruding with thoughts like "What if the wind shifts suddenly?" or "What if visibility deteriorates?"—integrating these intrusive simulations into decision-making to ensure safety in unpredictable situations.



### **5. Emotional Alignment in Human-Like AI**

**Application:** Emulating human-like emotional thought processes by introducing subconscious-like self-doubt or uncertainty.

**Example:** A mental health AI assistant supports users by suggesting questions like "What if you approached this problem differently?" or "What if the worst-case scenario doesn't happen?" to guide constructive reflection, akin to how subconscious intrusive thoughts can lead to self-improvement.
