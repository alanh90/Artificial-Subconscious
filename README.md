# Intrinsic Scenario Synthesis: Advancing Toward Subconscious Processing in AI

![Cover Image](media/cover_img.png)

## **Abstract**

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have traditionally operated on deterministic or goal-seeking models, focusing on explicit objectives and predefined pathways to achieve tasks. This approach often lacks the nuanced depth of human-like intuition and subconscious processing. The Intrinsic Scenario Synthesis (ISS) framework proposes a novel architectural layer that emulates subconscious thought processes within AI systems. Acting as an always-on generator of "intrusive thoughts," ISS continuously produces hypothetical scenarios, evaluates potential outcomes, and injects creative variability into the decision-making processes of connected AI systems.

By operating in the background and without explicit directives, ISS enhances adaptability, creativity, and risk awareness. It balances the exploration of unconventional ideas with the reliability of proven routines, aiming to bridge the gap between deterministic computation and human-like intuition. This paper outlines the conceptual structure, processes, and potential applications of ISS, laying the groundwork for future implementation and integration into broader AI architectures.

## **Introduction**

Human cognition is a complex, multi-layered system where the subconscious plays a critical role in guiding conscious thought, decision-making, creativity, and risk assessment. Subconscious processes often manifest as intrusive thoughts or spontaneous ideas that can influence actions without explicit intention. In contrast, conventional AI systems typically operate through explicit goal-seeking algorithms, lacking the depth and spontaneity of human subconscious processing.

The Intrinsic Scenario Synthesis (ISS) framework is envisioned to fill this gap by introducing a passive, background process within AI systems. ISS continuously generates possible scenarios, ranging from the highly plausible to the imaginative, and injects these into the system's decision-making pipeline. This approach allows AI systems to consider a broader range of options, enhancing creativity, adaptability, and risk awareness without dictating outcomes.

This document presents the theoretical underpinnings of ISS, detailing its multi-layered architecture, core components, and potential integration with existing AI systems. By emulating subconscious thought processes, ISS aims to advance AI towards more human-like cognition.

## **Objective**

The primary objective of the Intrinsic Scenario Synthesis (ISS) framework is to introduce a novel layer within AI architectures that emulates subconscious processing. ISS operates as a passive, always-on generator of hypothetical scenarios—"intrusive thoughts"—that enrich connected AI systems by providing creative variability, enhancing decision-making quality, and promoting risk-aware strategies.

### **Key Goals of ISS**

1. **Enhancing Decision-Making:**
   - **Broadening Perspectives:** By continuously providing a diverse range of plausible scenarios, ISS enables AI systems to consider options they might not independently generate.
   - **Improving Outcomes:** The inclusion of alternative possibilities can lead to more informed and optimal decisions.

2. **Creativity Injection:**
   - **Unconventional Ideas:** ISS introduces novel ideas by combining random variations with learned patterns from historical data.
   - **Innovation Facilitation:** Encourages AI systems to explore uncharted pathways, fostering innovation and creative problem-solving.

3. **Risk Mitigation:**
   - **Predictive Awareness:** By simulating potential pitfalls alongside successes, ISS promotes balanced decisions that account for risks.
   - **Preventative Strategies:** Helps in identifying and mitigating risks before they materialize.

The ISS framework's innovation lies in its ability to autonomously synthesize scenarios without explicit directives, acting as an idea generator that supplements higher-order decision systems.
