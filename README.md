# Artificial-Subconscious for AGI (Under Construction)

![Cover Image](media/cover_img.png)

## Overview
**Artificial-Subconscious** is an innovative system designed to simulate a subconscious-like process within an AI. Its operation can be summarized as:

$$
\text{AI}_{\text{subconscious}} = f(\text{Noise}, \text{Memory}, \text{Scenarios}) \rightarrow \text{Decision}
$$

Inspired by human cognition, this model processes raw inputs (noise), extracts meaningful insights, generates hypothetical scenarios, and evaluates them for relevance and risk. The ultimate goal is to enhance decision-making and adaptability in artificial intelligence systems, bridging the gap between human-like intuition and computational precision.

Primary objective:
$$
\text{Goal} = \text{Maximize Adaptability} + \text{Enhance Decision Precision}
$$

## Key Features

### **1. Layered Sub-Conscious Processing Architecture**
A multi-layered approach to simulate subconscious thought processes:

#### **Layer 1: Noise Generation**
- Generates foundational noise for subconscious simulation
- Combines:
  - Random noise
  - Relevant memory data related to the current situation

- Noise includes **valleys** and **peaks** to prioritize:
  - **Peaks:** Previous data with successful outcomes or benefits
  - **Valleys:** Data associated with negative consequences or risks

Key formula:
$$
N = Random + Memory_{weighted}
$$

Where memory weighting considers past successes and risks:
$$
Memory_{weighted} = Success_{weight} * Past_{success} - Risk_{weight} * Past_{risk}
$$

#### **Layer 2: Identification of Useful Data**
- Selects semi-random data points from Layer 1, including:
  - The highest peaks
  - Random noise around the peaks (for creativity)
  - The lowest valleys (for risk awareness)
- Introduces new random data related to the selected points as background noise

Pattern importance is calculated as:
$$
Value_{pattern} = \frac{Benefit_{historical}}{1 + Risk_{historical}}
$$

#### **Layer 3: Hypothetical Scenario Creation**
- Creates scenarios based on insights from Layer 2:
  - **High-benefit scenarios**
  - **High-risk scenarios** (to explore potential dangers)
  - **Random scenarios** (for creative problem-solving)

Each scenario is evaluated using:
$$
Benefit_{risk} = \alpha * Benefit - \gamma * Risk
$$

where:
- $\alpha$: Benefit weight
- $\gamma$: Risk weight

#### **Layer 4: Probability-Based Sorting**
- Consolidates scenarios with common patterns
- Selects the **top N scenarios** and the **worst high-risk scenarios**
- Integrates **memory** to apply a probability-based sorting mechanism using past experiences

Scenario ranking:
$$
Rank = \frac{Value * Success_{historical}}{Risk_{factor}}
$$

#### **Layer 5: Final Scenario Selection**
- Outputs the top N scenarios for the rest of the AI system to process and act upon
- Final selection considers both value and diversity:
$$
Selection_{score} = Value_{scenario} * Diversity_{factor}
$$

### **2. Dynamic Scenario Generation**
- Generates multiple possible futures or outcomes based on current inputs
- Evaluates scenarios to optimize benefits for the AI's current objectives

Evolution of scenarios:
$$
Next_{state} = Current_{state} + Learning + Randomness_{controlled}
$$

### **3. Risk and Benefit Analysis**
- Integrates risky or unconventional scenarios to expand decision-making options
- Assesses scenarios based on probability and historical occurrence for adaptive responses

Risk evaluation:
$$
Risk_{total} = Risk_{current} * (1 + Uncertainty_{factor})
$$

## Use Cases

### **1. Autonomous Systems**
- Enhancing adaptability and risk awareness in real-time decision-making
- Environmental adaptation through:
$$
Response_{adaptive} = Base_{response} * Environment_{factor}
$$

### **2. Strategic AI**
- Simulating multiple outcomes for complex problem-solving
$$
Strategy = \frac{1}{N} \sum (Scenarios * Probabilities)
$$

### **3. Creative AI**
- Generating imaginative or unconventional scenarios
$$
Ideas = Base_{knowledge} + Novel_{patterns} * Creativity_{factor}
$$

### **4. Risk Management**
- Balancing opportunities and dangers in critical applications
$$
Risk_{adaptive} = Base_{risk} * Environment_{factor} * Safety_{margin}
$$

## Why Artificial-Subconscious?
The project enhances AI capabilities through:
$$
AI_{enhanced} = Base_{AI} + Subconscious_{layer}
$$

This project aims to provide AI systems with a "subconscious" layer that operates beneath conscious decision-making, offering:
- **Improved Adaptability**: Processes complex and unstructured inputs to uncover meaningful insights
- **Enhanced Creativity**: Simulates diverse scenarios, including high-risk possibilities
- **Human-Like Intuition**: Mimics subconscious processing for better alignment with human-like reasoning

## Implementation Details
The system is implemented using a combination of:
- Neural networks for pattern recognition
- Monte Carlo methods for scenario simulation
- Bayesian inference for probability updates
- Markov processes for state transitions
